# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-VGG16
he study used a pre-trained VGG16 model with custom layers for pneumonia detection on chest X-rays, achieving 94.71% test accuracy after initial training on custom layers for 10 epochs and fine-tuning the top four layers for 10 more epochs with data augmentation and the Adam optimizer.
